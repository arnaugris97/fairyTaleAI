    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has come a long way with models like BERT, which help computers understand and generate human language more effectively. This progress opens up exciting possibilities for creating engaging and contextually rich stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for this project started from a personal experience within our team. One of us had a nephew who asked for a bedtime story about \"pirates in space.\" As Catalans who value storytelling but aren't all naturally imaginative, we struggled. Attempts to use existing generative models resulted in stories that missed the context and creativity the child wanted. This frustration highlighted a gap in current story generation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by this experience, we set out to create a better way to generate fairy tales that truly capture the magic and context of the themes kids ask for. We decided to train a BERT model specifically for this purpose and use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This way, when someone requests a story, the system can understand the request, find similar tales, and generate a new, engaging story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to provide a tool that can make storytelling easier and more fun, ensuring that every story is as imaginative and contextually rich as the ones we cherish from our childhood."

    "**Data Gathering**\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop an advanced story generation system, we needed a robust and diverse dataset of fairy tales. Our data collection process involved multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive dataset. Here’s how we approached it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kaggle**: We found several relevant datasets on Kaggle, including:\n",
    "   - [Grimm’s Fairy Tales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tschomacker/grimms-fairy-tales)\n",
    "   - [Grimms' Brother Fairy Tale Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cornellius/grimms-brother-fairy-tale-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hugging Face**: We utilized datasets from Hugging Face, such as:\n",
    "   - [FairytaleQA Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WorkInTheDark/FairytaleQA)\n",
    "   - [FairyTales Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KyiThinNu/FairyTales)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GitHub**: We accessed the FairytaleQA dataset from GitHub:\n",
    "   - [FairytaleQAData](https://github.com/uci-soe/FairytaleQAData/tree/main)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Web Scraping**: To supplement the datasets, we performed web scraping on various websites dedicated to fairy tales, including:\n",
    "   - [Dream Little Star](https://dreamlittlestar.com/)\n",
    "   - [Read the Tale](https://www.readthetale.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We used web scraping tools and techniques to extract text data from these sources, carefully handling HTML parsing and cleaning the text to make it suitable for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining datasets from these sources, we compiled a rich and diverse collection of fairy tales. This dataset was then preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies and ensure it was ready for training our BERT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the characteristics of our dataset, we performed a detailed analysis, including visualizations such as histograms. Below are some of the key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Story Length Distribution**: The histogram below shows the distribution of story lengths in the dataset.\n",

    "#### Dataset Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For training and validating our model, we have gathered a total of 1,183 fairy tales. Here are some key metrics of our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Sentences**: 128,541 sentences\n",
    "- **Mean Sentences per Story**: 114 sentences\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Rare Words**:\n",
    "   - **BPE**: Less effective at handling rare words due to its frequency-based merges.\n",
    "   - **WordPiece**: Breaks down rare words into smaller, meaningful subwords, improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Special Characters**:\n",
    "   - **BPE**: Lacks explicit handling of special characters.\n",
    "   - **WordPiece**: Includes special tokens for punctuation and spaces, providing accurate text representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vocabulary Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - **BPE**: Fixed number of merges can lead to suboptimal vocabulary size.\n",
    "   - **WordPiece**: Dynamically builds a balanced and efficient vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contextual Understanding**:\n",
    "   - **BPE**: May miss contextual nuances in narrative text.\n",
    "   - **WordPiece**: Better contextual understanding due to granular word breakdown and handling of special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The WordPiece tokenizer demonstrated superior performance in handling rare words, special characters, and providing efficient, contextually aware tokenization. These advantages make it the optimal choice for processing our fairy tale dataset and generating rich, engaging stories.\n"

    "As a second approach for building a model that generates coherent embeddings, we opted for fine-tuning a pretrained DistilBERT model. DistilBERT is a transformer model based on the already described BERT architecture, but containing 40% less parameters. The DistilBERT base model training uses knowledge distillation, which compresses a larger model known as teacher (in this case BERT) into a smaller model called student (in this case DistilBERT). Further information can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108).\n",

This model was originally trained using the BookCorpus and English Wikipedia datasets to perform the same objective tasks as we described previously: masked language modelling and next sentence prediction. The DistilBERT model's follows a practically identical architecture as the one previously described for the developed custom BERT model. In this case, however, the model contains 6 transformer encoder blocks.\n",

This way, the training process is simplified since the number of trainable weights is drastically reduced, while keeping unmodified the weights transfered from a more extensive pretraining process. \n",

The resulting figure can be found below. What it can be observed is that most of the embeddings are positioned in a small part of the feature's space and no clear clusters are formed in any of the tests. Furthermore, embeddings that come from the same text are also not clusterized and we couldn't observe any clear relation between the embeddings.
