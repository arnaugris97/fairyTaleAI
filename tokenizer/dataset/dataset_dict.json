At various times he has appeared on earth, under various names. His most celebrated incarnation, however, is that of Laotsze, \"The Old Child,\" which name he was given because he made his appearance on earth with white hair.\nHe acquired all sorts of magic powers by means of which he extended his life-span. Once he hired a servant to do his bidding. He agreed to give him a hundred pieces of copper daily; yet he did not pay him, and finally he owed him seven million, two hundred thousand pieces of copper. Then he mounted a black steer and rode to the West. He wanted to take his servant along. But when they reached the Han-Gu pass, the servant refused to go further, and insisted on being paid. Yet Laotsze gave him nothing.\nWhen they came to the house of the guardian of the pass, red clouds appeared in the sky. The guardian understood this sign and knew that a holy man was drawing near. So he went out to meet him and took him into his house. He questioned him with regard to hidden knowledge, but Laotsze only stuck out his tongue at him and would not say a word. Nevertheless, the guardian of the pass treated him with the greatest respect in his home. Laotsze's servant told the servant of the guardian that his master owed him a great deal of money, and begged the latter to put in a good word for him.\nWhen the guardian's servant heard how large a sum it was, he was tempted to win so wealthy a man for a son-in-law, and he married him to his daughter. Finally the guardian heard of the matter and came to Laotsze together with the servant. Then Laotsze said to his servant: \"You rascally servant. You really should have been dead long ago. I hired you, and since I was poor and could give you no money, I gave you a life-giving talisman to eat. That is how you still happen to be alive. I said to you: 'If you will follow me into the West, the land of Blessed Repose, I will pay you your wages in yellow gold. But you did not wish to do this.'\" And with that he patted his servant's neck. There upon the latter opened his mouth, and spat out the life-giving talisman. The magic signs written on it with cinnabar, quite fresh and well-preserved, might still be seen. But the servant suddenly collapsed and turned into a heap of dry bones.\nThen the guardian of the pass cast himself to earth and pleaded for him. He promised to pay the servant for Laotsze and begged the latter to restore him to life. So Laotsze placed the talisman among the bones and at once the servant came to life again. The guardian of the pass paid him his wages and dismissed him. Then he adored Laotsze as his master, and the latter taught him the art of eternal life, and left him his teachings, in five thousand words, which the guardian wrote down. The book which thus came into being is the Tao Teh King, \"The Book of the Way and Life.\" Laotsze then disappeared from the eyes of men. The guardian of the pass however, followed his teachings, and was given a place among the immortals.", "tokens": [7342, 56, 61, 60, 67, 46, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 2316, 56, 61, 60, 67, 46, 4704, 122,

Finn, who was\nvery fond of his wife, Oonagh, took it into his head that he would go\nhome and see how the poor woman got on in his absence. So accordingly he\npulled up a fir-tree, and after lopping off the roots and branches, made\na walking-stick of it and set out on his way to Oonagh.\nFinn lived at this time on Knockmany Hill, which faces Cullamore, that\nrises up, half hill, half mountain, on the opposite side.\nThe truth is that honest Finn's affection for his wife was by no manner\nof means the whole cause of his journey home. There was at that time\nanother giant, named Far Rua--some say he was Irish and some say he was\nScotch--but whether Scotch or Irish, sorrow doubt of it but he was a\ntarger. No other giant of the day could stand before him. Such\nwas his strength that, when well vexed, he could give a stamp that shook\nthe country about him. The fame and name of him went far and near, and\nnothing in the shape of a man, it was said, had any chance with him in a\nfight. Whether the story is true or not I cannot say, but the report\nwent that by one blow of his fist he flattened a thunderbolt, and kept\nit in his pocket in the shape of a pancake to show to all his enemies\nwhen they were about to fight him.\nUndoubtedly he had given every giant\nin Ireland a considerable beating, barring Finn M'Coul himself. He\nswore that he would never rest night or day, winter or summer, till he\ncould serve Finn with the same sauce, if he could catch him. Finn,\nhowever, had a strong disinclination to meet a giant who could make a\nyoung earthquake or flatten a thunderbolt when he was angry. Accordingly he kept dodging about from place to place--not much to his\ncredit as a Trojan, to be sure--whenever he happened to get the hard\nword that Far Rua was on the scent of him. And the long and the short of\nit was that he heard Far Rua was coming to the Causeway to have a trial\nof strength with him. He was, naturally enough, seized in\nconsequence with a very warm and sudden fit of affection for his wife,\nwho was delicate in her health, poor woman. She was leading, besides, a very\nlonely, uncomfortable life of it in his absence.\n\"God save all here,\" said Finn good-humouredly, putting his honest face\ninto his own door.\n\"Musha, Finn, avick, an' you're welcome to your own Oonagh, you darlin'\nbully.\" Here followed a smack that it is said to have made the waters of\nthe lake curl, as it were, with kindness and sympathy.\n\"Faith,\" said Finn, \"beautiful; and how are you, Oonagh--and how did\nyou sport your figure during my absence, my bilberry?\"\n\"Never a merrier--as bouncing a grass widow as ever there was in sweet\n'Tyrone among the bushes.'\"\nFinn gave a short, good-humoured cough. He laughed most heartily to\nshow her how much he was delighted that she made herself happy in his\nabsence.\n\"An' what brought you home so soon, Finn?\" said she.\n\"Why, avourneen,\" said Finn, putting in his answer in the proper way,\n\"never the thing but the purest of love and affection for yourself.\nSure, you know that's truth, anyhow, Oonagh.\"\nFinn spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very\ncomfortable considering the dread he had of Far Rua. This, however, grew\nupon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on\nhis mind which he kept altogether to himself. Let a woman alone in the\nmeantime for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man when\nshe wishes. Finn was a proof of this.\n\"It's this Far Rua,\" said he, \"that's troublin' me. When the fellow gets\nangry and begins to stamp he'll shake you a whole townland. It's\nwell known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always carries one\nabout with him in the shape of a pancake to show to anyone that might\nmisdoubt it.\"\nAs he spoke he clapped his thumb in his mouth, as he always did when he\nwanted to prophesy or to know anything.\n\"He's coming,\" said Finn. \"I see him below at Dungannon.\"\n\"An' who is it, avick?\"\n\"Far Rua,\" replied Finn, \"and how to manage I don't know. If I run away\nI am disgraced, and I know that sooner or later I must meet him, for my\nthumb tells me so.\"\n\"When will he be here?\" says she.\n\"To-morrow, about two o'clock,\" replied Finn with a groan.\n\"Don't be cast down,\" said Oonagh. \"Depend on me, and, maybe, I'll bring\nyou out of this scrape better than ever you could bring yourself.\"\nThis quieted Finn's heart very much, for he knew that Oonagh was\nhand-and-glove with the fairies. Indeed, to tell the truth, she was\nsupposed to be a fairy herself. If she was, however, she must have been\na kind-hearted one, for by all accounts she never did anything but good\nin the neighbourhood.\nNow, it so happened that Oonagh had a sister named Granua living\nopposite to them, on the very top of Cullamore, which I have mentioned\nalready. This Granua was quite as powerful as herself. The beautiful\nvalley that lies between the Granlisses is not more than three or four\nmiles broad, so that of a summer evening Granua and Oonagh were able to\nhold many an agreeable conversation across it, from one hill-top to the\nother. Upon this occasion Oonagh resolved to consult her sister as to\nwhat was best to be done in the difficulty that surrounded them.\n\"Granua,\" said she, \"are you at home?\"\n\"No,\" said the other, \"I'm picking bilberries at Althadhawan\" (the\nDevil's Glen).\n\"Well,\" said Oonagh, \"go up to the top of Cullamore, look about you, and\nthen tell us what you see.\"\n\"Very well,\" replied Granua, after a few minutes; \"I am there now.\"\n\"What do you see?\" asked the other.\n\"Goodness be about us!\" exclaimed Granua, \"I see the biggest giant that\never was known coming up from Dungannon.\"\n\"Ay,\" said Oonagh, \"there's our difficulty. That's Far Rua, and he's\ncomin' up now to leather Finn. What's to be done?\"\n\"I'll call to him,\" she replied, \"to come up to Cullamore and refresh\nhimself, and maybe that will give you and Finn time to think of some\nplan to get yourselves out of the scrape. But,\" she proceeded, \"I'm\nshort of butter, having in the house only half a dozen firkins, and as\nI'm to have a few giants and giantesses to spend the evenin' with me I'd\nfeel thankful, Oonagh, if you'd throw me up fifteen or sixteen tubs, or\nthe largest miscaun you've got, and you'll oblige me very much.\"\n\"I'll do that with a heart and a half,\" replied Oonagh; \"and, indeed,\nGranua, I feel myself under great obligations to you for your kindness\nin keeping him off us till we see what can be done; for what would\nbecome of us all if anything happened to Finn, poor man!\"\nShe accordingly got the largest miscaun of butter she had--which might\nbe about the weight of a couple of dozen millstones, so that you can\neasily judge of its size--and calling up her sister, \"Granua,\" says she,\n\"are you ready? I'm going to throw you up a miscaun, so be prepared to\ncatch it.\"\n\"I will,\" said the other. \"A good throw, now, and take care it does not\nfall short.\"\nOonagh threw it, but in consequence of her anxiety about Finn and Far\nRua she forgot to say the charm that was to send it up, so that instead\nof reaching Cullamore, as she expected, it fell about half-way between\nthe two hills at the edge of the Broad Bog, near Augher.\n\"My curse upon you!\" she exclaimed, \"you've disgraced me. I now change\nyou into a grey stone. Lie there as a testimony of what has happened,\nand may evil betide the first living man that will ever attempt to move\nor injure you!\"\nAnd, sure enough, there it lies to this day, with the mark of the four\nfingers and thumb imprinted on it, exactly as it came out of her hand.\n\"Never mind,\" said Granua, \"I must only do the best I can with Far Rua.\nIf all fail, I'll give him a cast of heather broth, or a panada of oak\nbark. But, above all things, think of some plan to get Finn out of the\nscrape he's in, or he's a lost man. You know you used to be sharp and\nready-witted; and my own opinion is, Oonagh, that it will go hard with\nyou, or you'll outdo Far Rua yet.\"\nShe then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she put\nher finger in her mouth and gave three whistles, and by that Far Rua\nknew that he was invited to the top of Cullamore--for this was the way\nthat the Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers to\nlet them know they are welcome to come and take share of whatever was\ngoing.\nIn the meantime Finn was very melancholy, and did not know what to do,\nor how to act at all. Far Rua was an ugly customer, no doubt, to meet\nwith; and, moreover, the idea of the confounded \"cake\" aforesaid\nflattened the very heart within him. What chance could he have, strong\nand brave as he was, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk\nthe country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? The\nthing was impossible, and Finn knew not on what hand to turn him. Right\nor left, backward or forward, where to go he could form no guess\nwhatever.\n\"Oonagh,\" said he, \"can you do anything for me? Where's all your\ninvention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes and to\nhave my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and me the\nbest man among them? How am I to fight this man-mountain--this huge\ncross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt--with a pancake in his\npocket that was once----?\"\n\"Be aisy, Finn,\" replied Oonagh. \"Troth, I'm ashamed of you. Keep your\ntoe in your pump, will you? Talking of pancakes, maybe we'll give him as\ngood as any he brings with him--thunderbolts or otherwise. If I don't\ntreat him to as smart feeding as he's got this many a day, don't trust\nOonagh again. Leave him to me, and do just as I bid you.\"\nThis relieved Finn very much, for, after all, he had great confidence in\nhis wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a\nquandary before. The present, however, was the greatest of all; but,\nstill, he began to get courage and to eat his victuals as usual. Oonagh\nthen drew the nine woollen threads of different colours, which she\nalways did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of\nimportance she went about. She then plaited them into three plaits, with\nthree colours in each, putting one on her right arm, one round her\nheart, and the third round her right ankle, for then she knew that\nnothing could fail her that she undertook.\nHaving everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and\nborrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded into\nthe hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she baked on the\nfire in the usual way, setting them aside in the cupboard according as\nthey were done. She then put down a large pot of new milk, which she\nmade into curds and whey, and gave Finn due instructions how to use the\ncurds when Far Rua should come. Having done all this, she sat down quite\ncontented waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o'clock,\nthat being the hour at which he was expected--for Finn knew as much by\nthe sucking of his thumb. Now, this was a curious property that Finn's\nthumb had; but notwithstanding all the wisdom and logic he used to suck\nout of it, it could never have stood to him here were it not for the wit\nof his wife. In this very thing, moreover, he was very much resembled by\nhis great foe, Far Rua; for it was well known that the huge strength\nthat he possessed all lay in the middle finger of his right hand, and\nthat if he happened by any chance to lose it, he was no more,\nnotwithstanding his bulk, than a common man.\nAt length the next day he was seen coming across the valley, and Oonagh\nknew that it was time to commence operations. She immediately made the\ncradle, and desired Finn to lie down in it and cover himself up with the\nclothes.\n\"You must pass for your own child,\" said she, \"so just lie there snug\nand say nothing, but be guided by me.\" This, to be sure, was wormwood to\nFinn--I mean going into the cradle in such a cowardly manner--but he\nknew Oonagh very well; and finding that he had nothing else for it, with\na very rueful face he gathered himself into it and lay snug, as she had\ndesired him.\nAbout two o'clock, as he had been expected, Far Rua came in. \"God save\nall here!\" said he. \"Is this where the great Finn M'Coul lives?\"\n\"Indeed it is, honest man,\" replied Oonagh. \"God save you kindly--won't\nyou be sitting?\"\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" says he, sitting down. \"You're Mrs. M'Coul, I\nsuppose?\"\n\"I am,\" says she, \"and I have no reason, I hope, to be ashamed of my\nhusband.\"\n\"No,\" said the other; \"he has the name of being the strongest and\nbravest man in Ireland. But, for all that, there's a man not far from\nyou that's very anxious of taking a shake with him. Is he at home?\"\n\"Why, no, then,\" she replied; \"and if ever a man left in a fury he did.\nIt appears that someone told him of a big bosthoon of a giant called Far\nRua being down at the Causeway to look for him, and so he set out there\nto try if he could catch him. Troth, I hope, for the poor giant's sake,\nhe won't meet with him, for if he does Finn will make paste of him at\nonce.\"\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"I am Far Rua, and I have been seeking him these\ntwelve minths, but he always kept clear of me; and I will never rest day\nor night till I lay my hands on him.\"\nAt this Oonagh set up a loud laugh of great contempt, by the way, and\nlooked at him as if he were only a mere handful of a man.\n\"Did you ever see Finn?\" said she, changing her manner all at once.\n\"How could I?\" said he. \"He always took care to keep his distance.\"\n\"I thought so,\" she replied. \"I judged as much; and if you take my\nadvice, you poor-looking creature, you'll pray night and day that you\nmay never see him, for I tell you it will be a black day for you when\nyou do. But, in the meantime, you perceive that the wind's on the door,\nand as Finn himself is far from home, maybe you'd be civil enough to\nturn the house, for it's always what Finn does when he's here.\"\nThis was a startler, even to Far Rua; but he got up, however, and after\npulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked three\ntimes, he went outside, and getting his arms about the house, completely\nturned it as she had wished. When Finn saw this he felt a certain\ndescription of moisture, which shall be nameless, oozing out through\nevery pore of his skin; but Oonagh, depending upon her woman's wit, felt\nnot a whit daunted.\n\"Arrah, then,\" said she, \"as you're so civil, maybe you'd do another\nobliging turn for us, as Finn's not here to do it himself. You see,\nafter this long stretch of dry weather that we've had, we feel very\nbadly off for want of water. Now, Finn says there's a fine spring well\nsomewhere under the rocks behind the hill there below, and it was his\nintention to pull them asunder; but having heard of you he left the\nplace in such a fury that he never thought of it. Now, if you try to\nfind it, troth, I'd feel it a kindness.\"\nShe then brought Far Rua down to see the place, which was then all one\nsolid rock; and after looking at it for some time, he cracked his right\nmiddle finger nine times, and, stooping down, tore a cleft about four\nhundred feet deep and a quarter of a mile in length, which has since\nbeen christened by the name of Lumford's Glen. This feat nearly threw\nOonagh herself off her guard; but what won't a woman's sagacity and\npresence of mind accomplish?\n\"You'll now come in,\" said she, \"and eat a bit of such humble fare as we\ncan give. Finn, even though you and he were enemies, would scorn not to\ntreat you kindly in his own house; and, indeed, if I didn't do it even\nin his absence, he would not be pleased with me.\"\nShe accordingly brought him in, and placing half a dozen of the cakes we\nspoke of before him, together with a can or two of butter, a side of\nboiled bacon, and a stack of cabbage, she desired him to help\nhimself--for this, be it known, was long before the invention of\npotatoes. Far Rua, who, by the way, was a glutton as well as a hero, put\none of the cakes in his mouth to take a huge whack out of it, when both\nFinn and Oonagh were stunned with a noise that resembled something\nbetween a growl and a yell. \"Blood and fury!\" he shouted out. \"How is\nthis? Here are two of my teeth out! What kind of bread is this you gave\nme?\"\n\"What's the matter?\" said Oonagh coolly.\n\"Matter!\" shouted the other. \"Why, here are two of the best teeth in my\nhead gone.\"\n\"Why,\" said she, \"that's Finn's bread--the only bread he ever eats when\nat home; but, indeed, I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat it but\nhimself and that child in the cradle there. I thought, however, that as\nyou were reported to be rather a stout little fellow of your size you\nmight be able to manage it, and I did not wish to affront a man that\nthinks himself able to fight Finn. Here's another cake--maybe it's not\nso hard as that.\"\nFar Rua, at the moment, was not only hungry, but ravenous, so he\naccordingly made a fresh set at the second cake, and immediately another\nyell was heard twice as loud as the first. \"Thunder and giblets!\" he\nroared, \"take your bread out of this, or I will not have a tooth in my\nhead; there's another pair of them gone.\"\n\"Well, honest man,\" replied Oonagh, \"if you're not able to eat the bread\nsay so quietly, and don't be awakening the child in the cradle there.\nThere, now, he's awake upon me!\"\nFinn now gave a skirl that frightened the giant, as coming from such a\nyoungster as he was represented to be. \"Mother,\" said he, \"I'm\nhungry--get me something to eat.\" Oonagh went over, and putting into\nhis hand a cake that had no griddle in it--Finn, whose appetite in the\nmeantime was sharpened by what he saw going forward, soon made it\ndisappear. Far Rua was thunderstruck, and secretly thanked his stars\nthat he had the good fortune to miss meeting Finn, for, as he said to\nhimself, I'd have no chance with a man who could eat such bread as that,\nwhich even his son that's in the cradle can munch before my eyes.\n\"I'd like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle,\" said he to\nOonagh, \"for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that\nnutriment is no joke to look at or to feed of a scarce summer.\"\n\"With all the veins of my heart,\" replied Oonagh. \"Get up, acushla, and\nshow this decent little man something that won't be unworthy of your\nfather, Finn M'Coul.\"\nFinn, who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as possible,\ngot up, and bringing Far Rua out, \"Are you strong?\" said he.\n\"Thunder and ounze!\" exclaimed the other, \"what a voice in so small a\nchap!\"\n\"Are you strong?\" said Finn again. \"Are you able to squeeze water out of\nthat white stone?\" he asked, putting one into Far Rua's hand. The latter\nsqueezed and squeezed the stone, but to no purpose; he might pull the\nrocks of Lumford's Glen asunder, and flatten a thunderbolt, but to\nsqueeze water out of a white stone was beyond his strength. Finn eyed\nhim with great contempt as he kept straining and squeezing and squeezing\nand straining till he got black in the face with the efforts.\n\"Ah, you're a poor creature,\" said Finn. \"You a giant! Give me the stone\nhere, and when I'll show what Finn's little son can do you may then\njudge of what my daddy himself is.\"\nFinn then took the stone, and then, slyly exchanging it for the curds,\nhe squeezed the latter until the whey, as clear as water, oozed out in a\nlittle shower from his hand.\n\"I'll now go in,\" said he, \"to my cradle; for I scorn to lose my time\nwith anyone that's not able to eat my daddy's bread, or squeeze water\nout of a stone. Bedad, you had better be off out of this before he comes\nback, for if he catches you, it's in flummery he'd have you in two\nminutes.\"\nFar Rua, seeing what he had seen, was of the same opinion himself; his\nknees knocked together with the terror of Finn's return, and he\naccordingly hastened in to bid Oonagh farewell, and to assure her that,\nfrom that day out, he never wished to hear of, much less to see, her\nhusband. \"I admit fairly that I'm not a match for him,\" said he, \"strong\nas I am. Tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague, and that I\nwill make myself scarce in this part of the country while I live.\"\nFinn, in the meantime, had gone into the cradle, where he lay very\nquietly, his heart in his mouth with delight that Far Rua was about to\ntake his departure without discovering the tricks that been played off\non him.\n\"It's well for you,\" said Oonagh, \"that he doesn't happen to be here,\nfor it's nothing but hawk's meat he'd make of you.\"\n\"I know that,\" said Far Rua, \"divel a thing else he'd make of me; but,\nbefore I go, will you let me feel what kind of teeth they are that can\neat griddle-cakes like that?\" and he pointed to it as he spoke.\n\"With all the pleasure in life,\" says she; \"only as they're far back in\nhis head you must put your finger a good way in.\"\nFar Rua was surprised to find so powerful a set of grinders in one so\nyoung; but he was still much more so on finding, when he took his hand\nfrom Finn's mouth, that he had left the very finger upon which his whole\nstrength depended behind him. He gave one loud groan and fell down at\nonce with terror and weakness. This was all Finn wanted, who now knew\nthat his most powerful and bitterest enemy was completely at his mercy.\nHe instantly started out of the cradle, and in a few minutes the great\nFar Rua, that was for such a length of time the terror of him and all\nhis followers, was no more.", "tokens": [105, 116, 46, 48, 46, 55, 45, 435, 1737, 5026, 54, 42, 55, 66, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 88, 61, 5404,

It had pretty little blue flowers, as delicate as the wings of a moth. The sun shone on it and the showers watered it. This was as good for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mothers. They look much prettier for it, and so did the flax. \"People say that I look exceedingly well,\" said the flax, \"and that I am so fine and long that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How fortunate I am! It makes me so happy to know that something can be made of me. How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain! My happiness overpowers me! No one in the world can feel happier than I.\"\n\"Ah, yes, no doubt,\" said the fern, \"but you do not know the world yet as well as I do, for my sticks are knotty\"; and then it sang quite mournfully:\n          \"Snip, snap, snurre,\n           Basse lurre.\n           The song is ended.\"\n\"No, it is not ended,\" said the flax. \"To-morrow the sun will shine or the rain descend. I feel that I am growing. I feel that I am in full blossom. I am the happiest of all creatures, for I may some day come to something.\"\nWell, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots, which was very painful. Then it was laid in water, as if it were to be drowned, and after that placed near a fire, as if it were to be roasted. All this was very shocking. \"We cannot expect to be happy always,\" said the flax. \"By experiencing evil as well as good we become wise.\" And certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the flax. It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and combed. Indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it. At last it was put on the spinning wheel. \"Whir, whir,\" went the wheel, so quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts. \"Well, I have been very happy,\" it thought in the midst of its pain, \"and must be contented with the past.\" And contented it remained, till it was put on the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen. All the flax, even to the last stalk, was used in making this one piece.\n\"Well, this is quite wonderful,\" said the flax. \"I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune. The fern was not wrong when it sang, \n        'Snip, snap, snurre,\n          Basse lurre.' \nBut the song is not ended yet, I am sure. It is only just beginning. How wonderful it is that, after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last! I am the luckiest person in the world--so strong and fine. And how white and long I am! This is far better than being a mere plant and bearing flowers. Then I had no attention, nor any water unless it rained. Now I am watched and cared for. Every morning the maid turns me over, and I have a shower bath from the watering-pot every evening. Yes, and the clergyman's wife noticed me and said I was the best piece of linen in the whole parish. I cannot be happier than I am now.\"\nAfter some time the linen was taken into the house, and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles. This certainly was not pleasant, but at last it was made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody wears. \"See now, then,\" said the flax, \"I have become something of importance. This was my destiny. It is quite a blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as every one ought to be. It is the only way to be happy. I am now divided into twelve pieces, and yet the whole dozen is all one and the same. It is most extraordinary good fortune.\"\nYears passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together. \"It must end very soon,\" said the pieces to each other. \"We would gladly have held together a little longer, but it is useless to expect impossibilities.\" And at length they fell into rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper. \"Well, now, this is a surprise--a glorious surprise too,\" said the paper. \"Now I am finer than ever, and who can tell what fine things I may have written upon me? This is wonderful luck!\" And so it was, for the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was remarkable good fortune. Then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it made them wiser and better; for all that was written had a good and sensible meaning, and a great blessing was contained in it.\n\"I never imagined anything like this when I was only a little blue flower growing in the fields,\" said the paper. \"How could I know that I should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to men? I cannot understand it myself, and yet it is really so. Heaven knows that I have done nothing myself but what I was obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation; and yet I have been promoted from one joy and honor to another. Each time I think that the song is ended, and then something higher and better begins for me. I suppose now I shall be sent out to journey about the world, so that people may read me. It cannot be otherwise, for I have more splendid thoughts written upon me than I had pretty flowers in olden times. I am happier than ever.\"\nBut the paper did not go on its travels. It was sent to the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type to make a book,--or rather many hundreds of books,--for many more persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book than from the written paper; and if the paper had been sent about the world, it would have been worn out before it had half finished its journey.\n\"Yes, this is certainly the wisest plan,\" said the written paper; \"I really did not think of this. I shall remain at home and be held in honor like some old grandfather, as I really am to all these new books. They will do some good. I could not have wandered about as they can, yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the most honored of all.\" Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse. \"After work, it is well to rest,\" said the paper, \"and a very good opportunity to collect one's thoughts. Now I am able, for the first time, to learn what is in me; and to know one's self is true progress. What will be done with me now, I wonder? No doubt I shall still go forward. I have always progressed hitherto, I know quite well.\"\nNow it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned. People said it could not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it had been written upon. The children in the house stood round the hearth to watch the blaze, for paper always flamed up so prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, there were so many red sparks to be seen running one after the other, here and there, as quick as the wind. They called it seeing the children come out of school, and the last spark, they said, was the schoolmaster. They would often think the last spark had come, and one would cry, \"There goes the schoolmaster,\" but the next moment another spark would appear, bright and beautiful. How they wanted to know where all the sparks went to! Perhaps they will find out some day.\nThe whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire and was soon burning. \"Ugh!\" cried the paper as it burst into a bright flame; \"ugh!\" It was certainly not very pleasant to be burned. But when the whole was wrapped in flames, the sparks mounted up into the air, higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little blue flowers, and they glistened as the white linen never could have glistened. All the written letters became quite red in a moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire.\n\"Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,\" said a voice in the flames; and it was as if a thousand voices echoed the words as the flames darted up through the chimney and went out at the top. Then a number of tiny beings, as many as the flowers on the flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above the children. They were even lighter and more delicate than the blue flowers from which they were born; and as the flames died out and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it, and wherever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared.\n\"The children are all out of school, and the schoolmaster was the last of all,\" said the children. It was good fun, and they sang over the dead ashes:\n          \"Snip, snap, snurre,\n           Basse lurre.\n           The song is ended.\"\nBut the little invisible beings said, \"The song is never ended; the most beautiful is yet to come.\" But the children could neither hear nor understand this; nor should they, for children must not know everything.", "tokens": [110, 53, 42, 65, 123,

He went to the king and\nbegged to be taken into service as a shepherd, and all called him\n\"Sheep-Peter.\" While he was herding his sheep, he used to amuse\nhimself with his crossbow. One day he saw a crane sitting in an\noak-tree, and wanted to shoot her. The crane, however, hopped down\nfurther and further, and at last settled in the lowest branches. Then\nshe said: \"If you promise not to shoot me, I will help you whenever\nyou are in trouble. You need only to call out: 'God aid me, and Queen\nCrane stay by me, and I will succeed!'\" With that the bird flew away.\nAt length war broke out and the king had to take the field. Then\nSheep-Peter came to the king and asked whether he might not be allowed\nto go along to war. They gave him an old nag to ride, and he rode into\na swamp along the highway, and there the horse died. So he sat down\nand clicked with his tongue; but the horse would not move. And the\npeople who rode by had their sport with him; while the youth pretended\nto feel sad.\nWhen the people had all passed by, the youth went to the oak in which\nthe Queen Crane dwelt. Here he was given a black steed, a suit of\nbrazen armor, and a silver sword. Thus he rode to battle and got there\nas quickly as he could wish. Then he said: \"God aid me, and Queen\nCrane stay by me, and I will succeed!\" With that he killed all the\nenemy and rode away again. But the king thought that an angel had come\nto help him, and wanted to hold him back. The youth, however, rode\nquickly back to the oak, took off his armor, went down to the swamp,\nand once more began to click to his horse. When the people rode by\nthey laughed and said: \"You were not along to-day, so you missed\nseeing how an angel came and killed all the enemy.\" And the youth\npretended to feel sad, so sad.\nThe following day the king once more had to take the field. And\nSheep-Peter came to him and said he wanted to go along. So they gave\nhim an old nag to ride, and he rode into a swamp beside the highway.\nThen he sat down and clicked with his tongue; but the horse would not\nmove. When the people rode by they had their sport with him; but the\nyouth pretended to feel sad, so sad. When the people had gone by, he\nwent to the oak in which the Queen Crane dwelt, and was given a white\nsteed, a suit of silver armor, and a golden sword. Thus equipped he\nrode to battle. When he arrived he said: \"God aid me, and Queen Crane\n... and I will succeed!\" But he had forgotten to say \"stay by me,\" and\nso he was shot in the leg. But the king took out his handkerchief, and\ntied up his leg. Then the youth said once more: \"God aid me, and Queen\nCrane stay by me, and I will succeed!\" And he slew all of the enemy.\nThen the king thought he was an angel from heaven, and wanted to hold\nhim. But the youth rode quickly to the oak, took off his armor, and\nthen went down to his nag in the swamp and tried to get it to move,\nwhile the soldiers were passing. They laughed and said: \"You were not\nalong to-day, and did not see how an angel came from heaven and killed\nall of the enemy.\" The youth pretended to be very sad.\nOn the third day all happened as before. The king took the field. The\nyouth was given a wretched nag and rode it into a swamp beside the\nhighway. Then he began to click with his tongue but the nag would not\ngo on, and the people who rode past laughed at him. He pretended to\nfeel very sad; but when the people had passed, he went to the oak in\nwhich Queen Crane dwelt, and she gave him a red steed, a golden sword,\nand a golden suit of armor. Thus equipped he rode to war, and all\nhappened as before. He said: \"God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me,\nand I will succeed!\" and slew all the enemy. The king thought he was\nan angel from heaven and wanted to hold him back by all means; but the\nyouth rode quickly to the oak, took off his armor, and rode down to\nthe swamp where he had his three nags. He hid the king's handkerchief,\nand when the people passed by he was clicking with his tongue as\nusual.\nNow the king had three princesses, and they were to be carried off by\nthree meer-women. So the king had it proclaimed that whoever could\nrescue them should receive one of them for a wife. When the day came\non which the oldest princess was to be carried away, Sheep-Peter\nreceived a steed, a suit of armor and a sword from Queen Crane. With\nthem he rode to the castle, fetched the princess, took her before him\non his steed, and then lay down on the sea-shore to sleep. He had a\ndog with him as well. And while he slept the princess wove her\nhair-ribbon into his hair. Suddenly the meer-woman appeared, and she\nawakened him and bade him mount his steed. Many people had been\nstanding there; but when the meer-woman appeared they all took fright,\nand climbed into tall trees. But the youth said: \"God aid me, and\nQueen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!\" And then he slew the\nmeer-woman. Thereupon he rode quickly back to Queen Crane, took off\nhis armor, and herded his sheep again. But among the on-lookers had\nbeen a nobleman, who threatened the princess, and forced her to say\nthat he had rescued her. And from Sheep-Peter no one heard a word.\nOn the following day the second princess was to be carried off. So\nSheep-Peter went to Queen Crane, who gave him a steed, a suit of armor\nand a sword, and with them he rode to the castle, and fetched the\nsecond princess. When they reached the sea-shore the meer-woman had\nnot yet appeared. So the youth lay down to sleep and said to the\nprincess: \"Wake me when the meer-woman comes, and if you cannot wake\nme, then tell my horse.\" With that he fell asleep, and meanwhile the\nprincess wove a string of pearls into his hair. When the meer-woman\ncame, the princess tried to wake him; but he would not wake up at all,\nand so she told the horse to waken him. And the horse did wake him.\nThe great lords, however, who were standing about, climbed into the\ntrees out of pure fright when the meer-woman appeared. The youth took\nthe princess on his steed, cried: \"God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by\nme, and I will succeed!\" and with that he slew the meer-woman. Then he\nrode quickly back to Queen Crane, took off his armor, and led his\nflock out to pasture. But among the on-lookers had been a count, who\nthreatened the princess, and said he would thrust her through with his\nsword if she did not swear he had rescued her. The princess did so out\nof fear; but from Sheep-Peter no one heard a word.\nOn the third day the same thing happened. Sheep-Peter was given a suit\nof armor, a sword and a steed by Queen Crane, and fetched the youngest\nprincess. When he lay down on the sea-shore to sleep, he said to her:\n\"When the meer-woman comes, wake me, and if you cannot wake me, then\ntell the horse to wake me, and if the horse cannot wake me, then ask\nthe dog to wake me.\" When the meer-woman came, neither the princess\nnor the horse was able to wake him, and they had to call the dog to\nhelp them. At last he woke up, took the princess on his horse, cried:\n\"God aid me, and Queen Crane stay by me, and I will succeed!\" and slew\nthe meer-woman. Then he rode back again to Queen Crane, took off his\narmor and let his flock out to pasture.\nNot long after, the deliverers of the princesses were to come to the\ncastle and be married. But first the king asked his daughters which of\nthe three each wanted to have. So the oldest said: \"The gentleman from\ncourt,\" and the second said: \"the count,\" but the third said\n\"Sheep-Peter.\" Then the king was very angry with his youngest\ndaughter; for he did not believe for a moment that Sheep-Peter had\ndelivered her. But she insisted and said she would take no one else.\nThe king then presented an apple of pure gold to the count and the\ncourt gentleman; but Sheep-Peter got nothing.\nNow all three of them were to hold a three-days' shooting-match, in\norder to see which was the best shot; for the king hoped that\nSheep-Peter would make a proper laughing-stock of himself, and drop\nfar behind the others without any effort on their part. But\nSheep-Peter was so good a marksman that he hit everything at which he\naimed. And the very first day he shot a great deal, while the others\nshot but little. Then they bought the game he had shot from him, and\ngave him a golden apple for it. The same thing happened the second\nday, and thus he got the other gold apple. But when Peter came home on\nthe evening of the first and second day, he had only a crow dangling\nfrom his blunderbuss. And when he met the king, he threw the crow to\nthe ground and cried: \"There is my whole bag!\"\nOn the third day all went as before. Sheep-Peter hit everything at\nwhich he aimed; but the others scored no hits. Then Sheep-Peter\npromised them all he had bagged, if they would let him write what he\nchose on their necks. They agreed to the bargain, and he wrote on the\nneck of each: \"A thief and a rascal.\" Then all three went home, and\nagain Peter had no more than a crow to show.\nAt night all three of them slept together in one room. When they woke\nin the morning, the king came in to them, said good-morning, and asked\nhow they were. But he was much surprised to see that Sheep-Peter was\nkeeping them company. Then the youth said: \"I was in the war, and slew\nall of the enemy!\" \"Ah!\" said the king, \"you did not do that, it was\nan angel from heaven; for you were sitting in the swamp.\" Then\nSheep-Peter drew out the king's handkerchief, and then the king\nrecognized him. Then the herdsman said: \"I also delivered the\nprincesses!\" But the king would not believe that, and laughed at him.\nAnd then the youngest princess came along and told how it all had\nhappened.\nAnd the youth took out the ribands of the other princesses, and the\nking had to believe that this, too, was true. Then, Peter continued:\n\"I also shot all the game!\" And again the king would not believe him\nand said: \"Nonsense, why you never brought home anything of an evening\nbut a wretched crow!\" Then Peter produced the golden apples: \"I was\ngiven this one for the first day, and the other for the second.\" \"And\nwhat did you get for the third?\" asked the king. Then the shepherd\nshowed him what he had written on the necks of the other suitors. And\nwhen the king saw that, he had to believe him. And so he really got\nthe youngest princess, and with her half of the kingdom, and after\nthe king's death, all of it. But the two sham heroes got nothing at\nall, and had only their trouble for their pains.", "tokens": [437, 46, 46, 55, 9642, 42, 55, 46, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 1236, 44, 46, 3912, 105, 8556, 46, 790,

poor old woman who had collected a\nmess of beans, and was going to cook them. So she made a fire on her\nhearth. In order to make it burn better, she put in a handful of\nstraw. When the beans began to bubble in the pot, one of them fell out\nand lay, never noticed, near a straw which was already there. Soon a\nred-hot coal jumped out of the fire and joined the pair. The straw began\nfirst, and said,\n\"Dear friends, how do you come here?\" The coal answered,\n\"I jumped out of the fire by great good luck, or I should certainly have\nmet with my death. I should have been burned to ashes.\" The bean said,\n\"I too have come out of it with a whole skin. If the old woman had\nkept me in the pot I should have been cooked into a soft mass like my\ncomrades.\"\n\"Nor should I have met with a better fate,\" said the straw. \"The old\nwoman has turned my brothers into fire and smoke, sixty of them she took\nup at once and deprived of life. Very luckily I managed to slip through\nher fingers.\"\n\"What had we better do now?\" said the coal.\n\"I think,\" answered the bean, \"that as we have been so lucky as to\nescape with our lives, we will join in good fellowship together.\nLest any more bad fortune should happen to us here, we will go abroad\ninto foreign lands.\"\nThe proposal pleased the two others, and forthwith they started on their\ntravels. Soon they came to a little brook, and as there was no\nstepping-stone, and no bridge, they could not tell how they were to get\nto the other side. The straw was struck with a good idea, and said,\n\"I will lay myself across, so that you can go over me as if I were a\nbridge!\"\nSo the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\nwho was of an ardent nature, quickly trotted up to go over the new-made\nbridge. When, however, she reached the middle, and heard the water\nrushing past beneath her, she was struck with terror, and stopped, and\ncould get no farther. So the straw began to get burnt, broke in two\npieces, and fell in the brook. The coal slipped down, hissing as she\ntouched the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean, who had prudently\nremained behind on the bank, could not help laughing at the sight.\nNot being able to contain herself, she went on laughing so excessively that\nshe burst. And now would she certainly have been undone for ever, if a\ntailor on his travels had not by good luck stopped to rest himself by\nthe brook. As he had a compassionate heart, he took out needle and\nthread and stitched her together again. The bean thanked him in the most\nelegant manner, but as he had sewn her up with black stitches, all beans\nsince then have a black seam.", "tokens": [790, 46, 123, 61, 59, 42, 64, 790, 46, 5573, 53,

story\nIt was a bright spring day, and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures, where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious.\nThe sheep had had a strange experience that morning, for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them, and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass and clipped all the heavy, soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears.\nThe sheep did not like this very well, for every once in a while the shears would pull the wool and hurt them; and when they were sheared they felt very strange, for it was almost as if someone took off all your clothes and let you run around naked. None of them were in a very good temper this morning, although the sun shone so warmly and the grass was so sweet, and as they watched the farmer and his man carry their wool up to the house in great bags, the old ram said, crossly,\n\"I hope they are satisfied, now that they have stolen from us all our soft, warm fleece.\"\n\"What are they going to do with it?\" asked one of the sheep.\n\"Oh, they will spin it into threads and make coats for the men and dresses for the women. For men are such strange creatures that no wool grows on them at all, and that is why they selfishly rob us of our fleece that they may cover their own skinny bodies!\"\n\"It must be horrid to be a man,\" said the Black Sheep, \"and not to have any wool grow on you at all. I'm sorry for that little boy that lives in the lane, for he will never be able to keep warm unless we give him some of our wool.\"\n\"But what a shame it is,\" continued the ram, \"for the farmer to steal all the wool from us when we have taken all the trouble to grow it!\"\n\"I don't mind,\" bleated a young lamb named Frisky, as it kicked up its heels and gambolled about upon the grass; \"it's nice to have all that heavy wool cut off my back, for I sha'n't have to carry it around wherever I go.\"\n\"Oh, indeed!\" sneered the ram, \"you like it, do you? Have you any idea what you look like, all sheared down to your skin? How would you like to have someone come along and see you, now that you are all head and legs?\"\n\"Oh, I wouldn't mind,\" said the lamb again; \"I shall grow more wool by winter-time, and I'm sure I don't look any worse than you do.\"\nSome of the sheep looked at the ram and began to giggle, for he was old and thin, and looked very comical indeed without any wool. And this made him so angry that he went off by himself and began eating grass, and would not speak to the others at all.\n\"I don't know why sheep should feel badly about having their fleeces cut,\" remarked the Black Sheep, thoughtfully, \"for the farmer is very kind to us, and so is his dame, and I am glad my wool serves to keep them warm in the winter. For before the snow comes our wool will grow out again, and we shall not be any the worse for our loss.\"\n\"What do those people who haven't any sheep do for clothes?\" asked the lamb.\n\"I'm sure I don't know. They must nearly freeze in the winter. Perhaps the ram can tell us.\"\nBut the ram was still angry, and refused to say anything, so the sheep stopped talking and began to scatter over the pasture and eat the tender, new grass.\nBy and by the Black Sheep wandered near the lane, and looking up, saw the little boy watching it through the bars.\n\"Good morning, Black Sheep,\" said the boy; \"why do you look so funny this morning?\"\n\"They have cut off my wool,\" answered the sheep.\n\"What will they do with it, Black Sheep?\" enquired the little boy.\n\"They will make coats of it, to keep themselves warm.\"\n\"I wish I had some wool,\" said the boy, \"for I need a new coat very badly, and mamma is so poor she cannot buy me one.\"\n\"That is too bad,\" replied the Black Sheep; \"but I shall have more wool by and by, and then I will give you a bagful to make a new coat from.\"\n\"Will you really?\" asked the boy, looking very much pleased.\n\"Indeed I will,\" answered the sheep, \"for you are always kind and have a pleasant word for me. So you watch until my wool grows again, and then you shall have your share of it.\"\n\"Oh, thank you!\" said the boy, and he ran away to tell his mother what the Black Sheep had said.\nWhen the farmer came into the field again the Black Sheep said to him,\n\"Master, how many bags of wool did you cut from my back?\"\n\"Two bags full,\" replied the farmer; \"and it was very nice wool indeed.\"\n\"If I grow three bags full the next time, may I have one bag for myself?\" asked the sheep.\n\"Why, what could you do with a bag of wool?\" questioned the farmer.\n\"I want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane. He is very poor and needs a new coat.\"\n\"Very well,\" answered the master; \"if you can grow three bags full I will give one to the little boy.\"\nSo the Black Sheep began to grow wool, and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock. She always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures, and drank from the clearest part of the brook, and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep-sorrel. And each day the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep and enquired how the wool was growing.\n\"I am getting along finely,\" the Black Sheep would answer, \"for not one sheep in the pasture has so much wool as I have grown already.\"\n\"Can I do anything to help you?\" asked the little boy.\n\"Not that I think of,\" replied the sheep, \"unless you could get me a little salt. I believe salt helps the wool to grow.\"\nSo the boy ran to the house and begged his mother for a handful of salt, and then he came back to the bars, where the Black Sheep licked it out of his hand.\nDay by day the wool on the sheep grew longer and longer, and even the old ram noticed it and said,\n\"You are foolish to grow so much wool, for the farmer will cut it all off, and it will do you no good. Now I am growing just as little as possible, for since he steals what I have I am determined he shall get very little wool from my back.\"\nBlack Sheep did not reply to this, for she thought the old ram very ill-tempered and selfish, and believed he was doing wrong not to grow more wool.\nFinally the time came to shear the sheep again, and the farmer and his man came into the pasture to look at them, and were surprised to see what a fine, big fleece the Black Sheep had grown.\n\"There will be three bagsful at the least,\" said the master, \"and I will keep my promise and give one to the little boy in the lane. But, my goodness! how scraggly and poor the old ram looks. There is scarcely any wool on him at all. I think I must sell him to the butcher!\"\nAnd, in truth, although the ram kicked and struggled and bleated with rage, they tied his legs and put him into the cart and carried him away to the butcher. And that was the last the sheep ever saw of him.\nBut the Black Sheep ran up to the bars by the lane and waited with a glad heart till the little boy came. When he saw the sheep waiting for him he asked,\n\"Black Sheep, Black Sheep, have you any wool?\"\nAnd the sheep replied,\n\"Yes my little master, three bags full!\"\n\"That is fine!\" said the boy; \"but who are the three bags for?\"\n\"One for my master, one for his dame,\nAnd one for the little boy that lives in the lane.\"\n\"Thank you, Black Sheep,\" said the little boy; \"you are very kind, and I shall always think of you when I wear my new coat.\"\nThe next day the sheep were all sheared, and the Black Sheep's fleece made three big bagsful. The farmer kept his promise and carried one bag to the little boy that lived in the lane, and the wool was so soft and so heavy that there was enough not only for the new coat, but to make his mother a warm dress as well.\nThe Black Sheep was very proud and happy when the mother and her little boy came down to the bars and showed the new clothes that had been made from the wool.\n\"This pays me for all my trouble,\" said the Black Sheep, and the little boy reached his hand through the bars and patted her gently upon the head.", "tokens": [5071, 2659, 46, 46, 57, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 88,

left in the lodge every day while he went out in quest of the animals whose flesh was their principal support.\nGame was very abundant in those days, and his labors in the chase were well rewarded. They lived a long distance from any other lodge, and it was seldom that they saw any other faces than those of their own household.\nThe two sons were still too young to follow their father in the hunt, and they were in the habit of diverting themselves within reach of the lodge.\nWhile thus engaged, they began to take note that a young man visited the lodge during their father's absence, and that these visits were constantly renewed.\nAt length the elder of the two said to his mother:\n\"My mother, who is this tall young man that comes here so often during our father's absence? Does he wish to see him? Shall I tell him when he comes back this evening?\"\n\"Naubesah, you little fool,\" said the mother, \"mind your bow and arrows, and do not be afraid to enter the forest in search of birds and squirrels, with your little brother. It is not manly to be ever about the lodge. Nor will you become a warrior if you tell all the little things that you see and hear to your father. Say not a word to him.\"\nThe boys obeyed, but as they grew older and still noticed the visits of the stranger, they resolved to speak again to their mother.\nThey now told her that they meant to make known to their father all that they had witnessed, for they frequently saw this young man passing through the woods, and he did not walk in the path, nor did he carry any thing to eat. If he had any message to deliver at their lodge, why did he not give it to their father? for they had observed that messages were always addressed to men, and not to women.\nWhen her sons spoke thus to her, the mother was greatly vexed.\n\"I will kill you,\" she said, \"if you speak of it.\"\nIn fear they for a time held their peace, but still taking note that the stranger came so often and by stealth to the lodge, they resolved at last to speak with their father.\nAccordingly one day, when they were out in the woods, learning to follow the chase, they told him all that they had seen.\nThe face of the father grew dark. He was still for a while, and when at length he looked up-\n\"It is done!\" he said. \"Do you, my children, tarry here until the hour of the falling of the sun, then come to the lodge and you will find me.\"\nThe father left them at a slow pace, and they remained sporting away their time till the hour for their return had come.\nWhen they reached the lodge the mother was not there. They dared not to ask their father whither she had gone, and from that day forth her name was never spoken again in the lodge.\nIn course of time the two boys had grown to be men, and although the mother was never more seen in the lodge, in charge of her household tasks, nor on the path in the forest, nor by the river side, she still lingered, ever and ever, near the lodge.\nChanged, but the same, with ghastly looks and arms that were withered, she appeared to her sons as they returned from the hunt, in the twilight, in the close of the day.\nAt night she darkly unlatched the lodge-door and glided in, and bent over them as they sought to sleep. Oftenest it was her bare brow, white, and bony, and bodyless, that they saw floating in the air, and making a mock of them in the wild paths of the forest, or in the midnight darkness of the lodge.\nShe was a terror to all their lives, and she made every spot where they had seen her, hideous to the living eye; so that after being long buffeted and beset, they at last resolved, together with their father, now stricken in years, to leave the country.\nThey began a journey toward the South. After traveling many days along the shore of a great lake, they passed around a craggy bluff, and came upon a scene where there was a rough fall of waters, and a river issuing forth from the lake.\nThey had no sooner come in sight of this fall of water, than they heard a rolling sound behind them, and looking back, they beheld the skull of a woman rolling along the beach. It seemed to be pursuing them, and it came on with great speed; when, behold, from out of the woods hard by, appeared a headless body, which made for the beach with the utmost dispatch.\nThe skull too advanced toward it, and when they looked again, lo! they had united, and were making all haste to come up with the hunter and his two sons. They now might well be in extreme fear, for they knew not how to escape her.\nAt this moment, one of them looked out and saw a stately crane sitting on a rock in the middle of the rapids. They called out to the bird, \"See, grandfather, we are persecuted. Come and take us across the falls that we may escape her.\"\nThe crane so addressed was of extraordinary size, and had arrived at a great old age, and, as might be expected, he sat, when first descried by the two sons, in a state of profound thought, revolving his long experience of life there in the midst of the most violent eddies.\nWhen he heard himself appealed to, the crane stretched forth his neck with great deliberation, and lifting himself slowly by his wings, he flew across to their assistance.\n\"Be careful,\" said the old crane, \"that you do not touch the crown of my head. I am bald from age and long service, and very tender at that spot. Should you be so unlucky as to lay a hand upon it, I shall not be able to avoid throwing you both in the rapids.\"\nThey paid strict heed to his directions, and were soon safely landed on the other shore of the river. He returned and carried the father in the same way; and then took his place once more where he had been first seen in the very midst of the eddies of the stream.\nBut the woman, who had by this time reached the shore, cried out, \"Come, my grandfather, and carry me over, for I have lost my children, and I am sorely distressed.\"\nThe aged bird obeyed her summons, and flew to her side. He carefully repeated the warning that she was not to touch the crown of his head; and he was so anxious that she should take it to heart, that he went over it a second and a third time, word by word. He begged her to bear in mind that she should respect his old age, if there was any sense of virtue left in her.\nShe promised to obey; but they were no sooner fairly embarked in the stream, than she stealthily sought to disregard the warning she had received. Instantly the crane cast her into the rapids, and shook his wings as if to free himself of all acquaintance with her.\n\"There,\" said he, as she sunk in the stream, \"you would ever do what was forbidden. In life, as you sought those you should have avoided, so now you shall be avoided by those who should seek you. Go, and be henceforth Addum Kum Maig!\"\nThe woman disappeared, was straightway carried by the rapid currents far out into the waters, and in the wide wilderness of shoreless depths, without companion or solace, was lost forever.\nThe family of the hunter, grateful for his generous help, adopted the bird as their family emblem or mark, and under the guardianship of the Crane that Crossed the River, they prospered, with days of plenty and nights of peace.", "tokens": [790, 46, 9642, 42, 55, 46, 790, 42, 61, 9645, 46, 45, 790, 46, 122, 9126, 46, 59, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 80, 9463, 4157, 112, 62,

"7": {"text": "gray eagle and his five brothers story\nThere were six falcons living in a nest, five of whom were still too\nyoung to fly, when it so happened that both the parent birds were shot\nin one day. The young brood waited anxiously for their return; but night\ncame, and they were left without parents and without food.\nGray Eagle, the eldest, and the only one whose feathers had become stout\nenough to enable him to leave the nest, took his place at the head of\nthe family, and assumed the duty of stifling their cries and providing\nthe little household with food, in which he was very successful. But,\nafter a short time had passed, by an unlucky mischance, while out on a\nforaging excursion, he got one of his wings broken.\nThis was the more to\nbe regretted, as the season had arrived when they were soon to go to a\nsouthern country to pass the winter, and the children were only waiting\nto become a little stronger and more expert on the wing to set out on\nthe journey.\nFinding that their elder brother did not return, they resolved to go in\nsearch of him. After beating up and down the country for the better part\nof a whole day, they at last found him, sorely wounded and unable to\nfly, lodged in the upper branches of a sycamore-tree.\n\"Brothers,\" said Gray Eagle, as soon as they were gathered around, and\nquestioned him as to the extent of his injuries, \"an accident has\nbefallen me, but let not this prevent your going to a warmer climate.\nWinter is rapidly approaching, and you can not remain here. It is better\nthat I alone should die, than for you all to suffer on my account.\"\n\"No, no,\" they replied, with one voice. \"We will not forsake you. We\nwill share your sufferings; we will abandon our journey, and take care\nof you as you did of us before we were able to take care of ourselves.\nIf the chill climate kills you, it shall kill us. Do you think we can so\nsoon forget your brotherly care, which has equaled a father's, and even\na mother's kindness? Whether you live or die, we will live or die with\nyou.\"\nThey sought out a hollow tree to winter in, and contrived to carry their\nwounded nest-mate thither; and before the rigor of the season had set\nin, they had, by diligence and economy, stored up food enough to carry\nthem through the winter months.\nTo make the provisions they had laid in last the better, it was agreed\namong them that two of their number should go south; leaving the other\nthree to watch over, feed, and protect their wounded brother. The\ntravelers set forth, sorry to leave home, but resolved that the first\npromise of spring should bring them back again. At the close of day, the\nthree brothers who remained, mounting to the very peak of the tree, and\nbearing Gray Eagle in their arms, watched them, as they vanished away\nsouthward, till their forms blended with the air and were wholly lost to\nsight.\nTheir next business was to set the household in order, and this, with\nthe judicious direction of Gray Eagle, who was propped up in a snug\nfork, with soft cushions of dry moss, they speedily accomplished. One of\nthe sisters, for there were two of these, took upon herself the charge\nof nursing Gray Eagle, preparing his food, bringing him water, and\nchanging his pillows when he grew tired of one position. She also looked\nto it that the house itself was kept in a tidy condition, and that the\npantry was supplied with food. The second brother was assigned the duty\nof physician, and he was to prescribe such herbs and other medicines as\nthe state of the health of Gray Eagle seemed to require.\nAs the second\nbrother had no other invalid on his visiting-list, he devoted the time\nnot given to the cure of his patient, to the killing of game wherewith\nto stock the house-keeper's larder; so that, whatever he did, he was\nalways busy in the line of professional duty--killing or curing. On his\nhunting excursions, Doctor Falcon carried with him his youngest brother,\nwho, being a foolish young fellow, and inexperienced in the ways of the\nworld, it was not thought safe to trust alone.\nIn due time, what with good nursing, and good feeding, and good air,\nGray Eagle recovered from his wound, and he repaid the kindness of his\nbrothers by giving them such advice and instruction in the art of\nhunting as his age and experience qualified him to impart. As spring\nadvanced, they began to look about for the means of replenishing their\nstore-house, whose supplies were running low; and they were all quite\nsuccessful in their quest except the youngest, whose name was Peepi, or\nthe Pigeon-Hawk, and who had of late begun to set up for himself.\nBeing\nsmall and foolish, and feather-headed, flying hither and yonder without\nany set purpose, it so happened that Peepi always came home, so to\nphrase it, with an empty game-bag, and his pinions terribly rumpled.\nAt last Gray Eagle spoke to him, and demanded the cause of his ill-luck.\n\"It is not my smallness nor weakness of body,\" Peepi answered, \"that\nprevents my bringing home provender as well as my brothers. I am all the\ntime on the wing, hither and thither. I kill ducks and other birds every\ntime I go out; but just as I get to the woods, on my way home, I am met\nby a large ko-ko-ho, who robs me of my prey; and,\" added Peepi, with\ngreat energy, \"it's my settled opinion that the villain lies in wait for\nthe very purpose of doing so.\"\n\"I have no doubt you are right, Brother Peepi,\" rejoined Gray Eagle. \"I\nknow this pirate--his name is White Owl; and now that I feel my strength\nfully recovered, I will go out with you to-morrow and help you look\nafter this greedy bush-ranger.\"\nThe next day they went forth in company, and arrived at a fine\nfresh-water lake. Gray Eagle seated himself hard by, while Peepi started\nout, and soon pounced upon a duck.\n\"Well done!\" thought his brother, who saw his success; but just as\nlittle Peepi was getting to land with his prize, up sailed a large white\nowl from a tree where he, too, had been watching, and laid claim to it.\nHe was on the point of wresting it from Peepi, when Gray Eagle, calling\nout to the intruder to desist, rushed up, and, fixing his talons in both\nsides of the owl, without further introduction or ceremony, flew away\nwith him.\nThe little Pigeon-Hawk followed closely, with the duck under his wing,\nrejoiced and happy to think that he had something to carry home at last.\nHe was naturally much vexed with the owl, and had no sooner delivered\nover the duck to his sister, the housekeeper, than he flew in the owl's\nface, and, venting an abundance of reproachful terms, would, in his\npassion, have torn the very eyes out of the White Owl's head.\n\"Softly, Peepi,\" said the Gray Eagle, stepping in between them. \"Don't\nbe in such a huff, my little brother, nor exhibit so revengeful a\ntemper. Do you not know that we are to forgive our enemies? White Owl,\nyou may go; but let this be a lesson to you, not to play the tyrant over\nthose who may chance to be weaker than yourself.\"\nSo, after adding to this much more good advice, and telling him what\nkind of herbs would cure his wounds, Gray Eagle dismissed White Owl, and\nthe four brothers and sisters sat down to supper.\nThe next day, betimes, in the morning, before the household had fairly\nrubbed the cobwebs out of the corners of their eyes, there came a knock\nat the front door--which was a dry branch that lay down before the\nhollow of the tree in which they lodged--and being called to come in,\nwho should make their appearance but the two nest-mates, who had just\nreturned from the South, where they had been wintering. There was great\nrejoicing over their return, and now that they were all happily\nre-united, each one soon chose a mate and began to keep house in the\nwoods for himself.\nSpring had now revisited the North. The cold winds had all blown\nthemselves away, the ice had melted, the streams were open, and smiled\nas they looked at the blue sky once more; and the forests, far and wide,\nin their green mantle, echoed every cheerful sound.\nBut it is in vain that spring returns, and that the heart of Nature is\nopened in bounty, if we are not thankful to the Master of Life, who has\npreserved us through the winter. Nor does that man answer the end for\nwhich he was made who does not show a kind and charitable feeling to all\nwho are in want or sickness, especially to his blood relations.\nThe love and harmony of Gray Eagle and his brothers continued. They\nnever forgot each other. Every week, on the fourth afternoon of the week\n(for that was the time when they had found their wounded elder brother),\nthey had a meeting in the hollow of the old sycamore-tree, when they\ntalked

glass slipper story\nOnce there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.\nNo sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam's chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot.\nThe poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.\nIt happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new trouble to Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen, and plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed.\n\"For my part,\" said the eldest, \"I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.\" \n\"And I,\" said the youngest, \"shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.\"\nThey sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.\nCinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:\n\"Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?\"\n\"Alas!\" said she, \"you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go there.\"\n\"You are in the right of it,\" replied they; \"it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.\"\nAnyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.\nHer godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.\n\"I wish I could-I wish I could-\"; she was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.\nThis godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, \"You wish you could go to the ball; is it not so?\"\n\"Y-es,\" cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.\n\"Well,\" said her godmother, \"be but a good girl, and I will contrive that you shall go.\" Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, \"Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.\"\nCinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.\nShe then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when, giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being at a loss for a coachman,\n\"I will go and see,\" says Cinderella, \"if there is never a rat in the rat-trap-we may make a coachman of him.\"\n\"You are in the right,\" replied her godmother; \"go and look.\"\nCinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld. After that, she said to her:\n\"Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering-pot, bring them to me.\"\nShe had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy then said to Cinderella:\n\"Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not pleased with it?\"\n\"Oh! yes,\" cried she; \"but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?\"\nHer godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they were before.\nShe promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for joy. The King's son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company. There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of:\n\"Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!\"\nThe King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.\nAll the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.\nThe King's son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing on her.\nShe went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.\nWhen she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.\nAs she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and opened.\n\"How long you have stayed!\" cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home.\n\"If you had been at the ball,\" said one of her sisters, \"you would not have been tired with it. There came there the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.\"\nCinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that the King's son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:\n\"She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been! Could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day.\"\n\"Ay, to be sure!\" cried Miss Charlotte; \"lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you are! I should be a fool.\"\nCinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly.\nThe next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The King's son was always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked:\nIf they had not seen a princess go out.\nWho said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.\nWhen the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them: If they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.\nThey told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.\nWhat they said was very true; for a few days after the King's son caused it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot the slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to try it upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it. Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing:\n\"Let me see if it will not fit me.\"\nHer sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said:\nIt was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let everyone make trial.\nHe obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella's clothes, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.\nAnd now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried:\nThat she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to love her.\nShe was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her. Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the Court.", "tokens": [107, 50, 55, 45, 46,

The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; he packed them in a big hamper.\nThe gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed. Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in the wicker-work, and after eating some peas-Timmy Willie fell fast asleep.\nHe awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart. Then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horse's feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles-jolt-jolt-jolt! and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables.\nAt last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. The cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away. But there was no quiet; there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing. Dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine.\nTimmy Willie, who had lived all his life in a garden, was almost frightened to death. Presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables. Out sprang the terrified Timmy Willie.\nUp jumped the cook on a chair, exclaiming \"A mouse! a mouse! Call the cat! Fetch me the poker, Sarah!\" Timmy Willie did not wait for Sarah with the poker; he rushed along the skirting board till he came to a little hole, and in he popped.\nHe dropped half a foot, and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party, breaking three glasses.-\"Who in the world is this?\" inquired Johnny Town-mouse. But after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners.\nWith the utmost politeness he introduced Timmy Willie to nine other mice, all with long tails and white neckties. Timmy Willie's own tail was insignificant. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends noticed it; but they were too well bred to make personal remarks; only one of them asked Timmy Willie if he had ever been in a trap?\nThe dinner was of eight courses; not much of anything, but truly elegant. All the dishes were unknown to Timmy Willie, who would have been a little afraid of tasting them; only he was very hungry, and very anxious to behave with company manners. The continual noise upstairs made him so nervous, that he dropped a plate. \"Never mind, they don't belong to us,\" said Johnny.\n\"Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?\" It should be explained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses. Several times they had come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; Timmy Willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat. His appetite failed, he felt faint. \"Try some jelly?\" said Johnny Town-mouse.\n\"No? Would you rather go to bed? I will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow.\"\nThe sofa pillow had a hole in it. Johnny Town-mouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed, kept exclusively for visitors. But the sofa smelt of cat. Timmy Willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender.\nIt was just the same next day. An excellent breakfast was provided-for mice accustomed to eat bacon; but Timmy Willie had been reared on roots and salad. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the floors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening. One particularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs with the tea-tray; there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be collected, in spite of the cat.\nTimmy Willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank. The food disagreed with him; the noise prevented him from sleeping. In a few days he grew so thin that Johnny Town-mouse noticed it, and questioned him. He listened to Timmy Willie's story and inquired about the garden. \"It sounds rather a dull place? What do you do when it rains?\"\n\"When it rains, I sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my Autumn store. I peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn, and my friend Cock Robin. And when the sun comes out again, you should see my garden and the flowers-roses and pinks and pansies-no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows.\"\n\"There goes that cat again!\" exclaimed Johnny Town-mouse. When they had taken refuge in the coal-cellar he resumed the conversation; \"I confess I am a little disappointed; we have endeavoured to entertain you, Timothy William.\"\n\"Oh yes, yes, you have been most kind; but I do feel so ill,\" said Timmy Willie.\n\"It may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food; perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper.\"\n\"Oh? Oh!\" cried Timmy Willie.\n\"Why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week,\" said Johnny rather huffily-\"did you not know that the hamper goes back empty on Saturdays?\"\nSo Timmy Willie said good-bye to his new friends, and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf; and after much jolting, he was set down safely in his own garden.\nSometimes on Saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate, but he knew better than to get in again. And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse had half promised a visit.\nThe winter passed; the sun came out again; Timmy Willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass. He had nearly forgotten his visit to town. When up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came Johnny Town-mouse!\nTimmy Willie received him with open arms. \"You have come at the best of all the year, we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun.\"\n\"H'm'm! it is a little damp,\" said Johnny Town-mouse, who was carrying his tail under his arm, out of the mud.\n\"What is that fearful noise?\" he started violently.\n\"That?\" said Timmy Willie, \"that is only a cow; I will beg a little milk, they are quite harmless, unless they happen to lie down upon you. How are all our friends?\"\nJohnny's account was rather middling. He explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season; the family had gone to the sea-side for Easter; the cook was doing spring cleaning, on board wages, with particular instructions to clear out the mice. There were four kittens, and the cat had killed the canary.\n\"They say we did it; but I know better,\" said Johnny Town-mouse. \"Whatever is that fearful racket?\"\n\"That is only the lawn-mower; I will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed. I am sure you had better settle in the country, Johnny.\"\n\"H'm'm-we shall see by Tuesday week; the hamper is stopped while they are at the sea-side.\"\n\"I am sure you will never want to live in town again,\" said Timmy Willie.\nBut he did. He went back in the very next hamper of vegetables; he said it was too quiet!!\nOne place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie.", "tokens": [124, 42, 53, 46, 435, 774, 49, 55, 55, 66, 2427, 5810, 60, 46, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 1704, 55, 66, 2477, 5345, 62, 60,

"wunzh the father of indian corn story\nIn time past--we can not tell exactly how many, many years ago--a poor\nIndian was living, with his wife and children, in a beautiful part of\nthe country. He was not only poor, but he had the misfortune to be\ninexpert in procuring food for his family. His children were all too\nyoung to give him assistance.\nAlthough of a lowly condition and straitened in his circumstances, he\nwas a man of kind and contented disposition. He was always thankful to\nthe Great Spirit for every thing he received. He even stood in the door\nof his lodge to bless the birds that flew past in the summer evenings.\nAlthough, if he had been of a complaining temper, he might have repined\nthat they were not rather spread upon the table for his evening meal.\nThe same gracious and sweet disposition was inherited by his eldest son,\nwho had now arrived at the proper age to undertake the ceremony of the\nfast. This was to learn what kind of a spirit would be his guide and guardian\nthrough life.\nWunzh, for this was his name, had been an obedient boy from his\ninfancy--pensive, thoughtful, and gentle--so that he was beloved by the\nwhole family.\nAs soon as the first buds of spring appeared, and the delicious\nfragrance of the young year began to sweeten the air, his father, with\nthe help of his younger brothers, built for Wunzh the customary little\nlodge. It was at a retired spot at some distance from their own, where he would\nnot be disturbed during the solemn rite.\nTo prepare himself, Wunzh sought to clear his heart of every evil\nthought, and to think of nothing that was not good, and beautiful, and\nkindly.\nThat he might store his mind with pleasant ideas for his dreams, for the\nfirst few days he amused himself by walking in the woods and over the\nmountains, examining the early plants and flowers.\nAs he rambled far and wide, through the wild country, he felt a strong\ndesire to know how the plants and herbs and berries grew, without any\naid from man. He wondered why it was that some kinds were good to eat, and that\nothers were possessed of medicinal or poisonous power.\nAfter he had become too weak to walk about, and confined himself\nstrictly to the lodge, he recalled these thoughts, and turning them in\nhis mind, he wished he could dream of something that would prove a\nbenefit to his father and family, and to all others of his\nfellow-creatures.\n\"True,\" thought Wunzh, \"the Great Spirit made all things, and it is to\nhim that we owe our lives. Could he not make it easier for us to get our\nfood, than by hunting animals and taking fish? I must try to find this\nout in my visions.\"\nOn the third day Wunzh became weak and faint, and kept his bed. Suddenly\nhe fancied, as he lay thus, that a bright light came in at the lodge\ndoor. Before he was aware, he saw a handsome young man, with a\ncomplexion of the softest and purest white, coming down from the sky,\nand advancing toward him.\nThe beautiful stranger was richly and gayly dressed, having on a great\nmany garments of green and yellow colors, but differing in their deeper\nor lighter shades. He had a plume of waving feathers on his head, and\nall his motions were graceful. He reminded Wunzh of the deep green of\nthe summer grass, and the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle\nblowing of the summer wind. Beautiful as the stranger was, he paused on\na little mound of earth, just before the door of the lodge.\n\"I am sent to you, my friend,\" said this celestial visitor, in a voice\nmost soft and musical to listen to. \"I am sent to you by that Great\nSpirit who made all things in the sky, and on the earth. He has seen and\nknows your motives in fasting. He sees that it is from a kind and\nbenevolent wish to do good to your people, and to procure a benefit for\nthem. He sees that you do not seek for strength in war, or the praise of the men\nof the bloody hand. I am sent to instruct you and to show you how you\ncan do your kindred good.\"\nHe then told the young man to arise, and to prepare to wrestle with him.\nIt was only by this means that he could hope to succeed in his\nwishes.\nWunzh knew how weak he was from fasting, but the voice of the stranger\nwas cheery, and put such a courage in his heart, that he promptly sprang\nup, determined to die rather than fail. Brave Wunzh! if you ever\naccomplish any thing, it will be through the power of the resolve that\nspoke within you at that moment.\nHe began the trial, and after a long-sustained struggle he was almost\noverpowered, when the beautiful stranger said:\n\"My friend, it is enough for once, I will come again to try you;\" and\nsmiling on him, he returned through the air in the same direction in\nwhich he had come.\nThe next day, although he saw how sweetly the wild-flowers bloomed upon\nthe slopes, and the birds warbled from the woodland, he longed to see\nthe celestial visitor, and to hear his voice.\nTo his great joy he reappeared at the same hour, toward the going down\nof the sun, and re-challenged Wunzh to a trial of strength.\nThe brave Wunzh felt that his strength of body was even less than on the\nday before, but the courage of his mind seemed to grow. Observing this,\nand how Wunzh put his whole heart in the struggle, the stranger again\nspoke to him in the words he used before, adding:\n\"To-morrow will be your last trial. Be strong, my friend, for this is\nthe only way in which you can overcome me and obtain the boon you seek.\"\nThe light which shone after him as he left Wunzh was brighter than\nbefore.\nOn the third day he came again and renewed the struggle. Very faint in\nbody was poor Wunzh, but he was stronger at heart than ever, and\ndetermined to prevail now or perish. He put forth his utmost powers, and\nafter a contest more severe than either of the others, the stranger\nceased his efforts, and declared himself conquered.\nFor the first time he entered Wunzh's little fasting-lodge. Sitting\ndown beside the youth, he began to deliver his instructions to him and\nto inform him in what manner he should proceed to take advantage of his\nvictory.\n\"You have won your desire of the Great Spirit,\" said the beautiful\nstranger. \"You have wrestled manfully. To-morrow will be the seventh day\nof your fasting. Your father will give you food to strengthen you, and\nas it is the last day of trial you will prevail. I know this, and now\ntell you what you must do to benefit your family and your people.\nTomorrow,\" he repeated, \"I shall meet you and wrestle with you for the\nlast time. As soon as you have prevailed against me, you will strip off\nmy garments and throw me down, clean the earth of roots and weeds, make\nit soft, and bury me in the spot. When you have done this, leave my body\nin the earth, and do not disturb it. Come at times to visit the\nplace, to see whether I have come to life. Above all be careful to\nnever let the grass or weeds grow upon my grave. Once a month cover me\nwith fresh earth. If you follow these my instructions you will\naccomplish your object of doing good to your fellow-creatures by\nteaching them the knowledge I now teach you.\"\nHe then shook Wunzh by the hand and disappeared, but he was gone so soon\nthat Wunzh could not tell what direction he took.\nIn the morning, Wunzh's father came to his lodge with some slight\nrefreshments, saying:\n\"My son, you have fasted long enough. If the Great Spirit will favor\nyou, he will do it now. It is seven days since you have tasted food, and\nyou must not sacrifice your life. The Master of Life does not require\nthat.\"\n\"My father,\" replied Wunzh, \"wait till the sun goes down. I have a\nparticular reason for extending my fast to that hour.\"\n\"Very well,\" said the old man, \"I shall wait till the hour arrives, and\nyou shall be inclined to eat.\"\nAt his usual hour of appearing, the beautiful sky-visitor returned, and\nthe trial of strength was renewed. Although he had not availed himself\nof his father's offer of food, Wunzh felt that new strength had been\ngiven him. His heart was mighty within him to achieve some great\npurpose. Courage was like the eagle that spreads his wings within the\ntree-top for a great flight, within the bosom of the brave Wunzh.\nHe grasped his angel challenger with supernatural strength and threw him\ndown. Mindful of his own instructions, he tore from him his beautiful\ngarments and plume. Finding him dead, he immediately buried him on\nthe spot, using all the precautions he had been told of. Very\nconfident was Wunzh, all the time, that his friend would again come to\nlife.\nWunzh now returned to his father's lodge, where he was warmly welcomed.\nAs it had been appointed to him during the days of his fasting to\nwalk apart with Heaven, he was not permitted to see any human face save\nthat of his father, the representative to the little household upon\nearth of the Good Father who is in Heaven.\nWunzh partook sparingly of the meal that had been prepared for him, and\nonce more mingled in the cares and sports of the family. But he never\nfor a moment forgot the grave of his friend. He carefully visited it\nthroughout the spring, and weeded out the grass, and kept the ground in\na soft and pliant state. Sometimes, when the brave Wunzh thought of\nhis friend that was gone from his sight, he dropped a tear upon the\nearth where he lay.\nWatching and tending, and moistening the earth with his tears, it was\nnot long before Wunzh saw the tops of green plumes coming through the\nground. The more faithful he was in obeying his instructions in\nkeeping the ground in order, and in cherishing the memory of his\ndeparted friend, the faster they grew. He was, however, careful to\nconceal the charge of the earth which he had from his father.\nDays and weeks had passed in this way. The summer was drawing toward a\nclose, when one day, after a long absence in hunting, Wunzh invited his\nfather to follow him to the quiet and lonesome spot of his former fast.\nThe little fasting-lodge had been removed, and the weeds kept from\ngrowing on the circle where it had stood. In its place rose a tall\nand graceful plant, surmounted with nodding plumes and stately leaves,\nand golden clusters. There was in its aspect and bearing the deep green\nof the summer grass, the clear amber of the summer sky, and the gentle\nblowing of the summer wind.\n\"It is my friend!\" shouted Wunzh, \"it is the friend of all mankind. It\nis Mondawmin: it is our Indian Corn! We need no longer rely on hunting\nalone, for as long as this gift is cherished and taken care of, the\nground itself will give us a living.\"\nHe then pulled an ear.\n\"See, my father,\" said he, \"this is what I fasted for. The Great Spirit\nhas listened to my voice, and sent us something new, and henceforth our\npeople will not alone depend upon the chase or upon the waters.\"\nWunzh then communicated to his father the instructions given to him by\nthe stranger. He told him that the broad husks must be torn away, as he\nhad pulled off the garments in his wrestling. Having done this, he\ndirected him how the ear must be held before the fire till the outer\nskin became brown--as he complexion of his angel friend had been tinted\nby the sun--while all the milk was retained in the grain.\nThe whole family, in high spirits, and deeply grateful to the Merciful\nMaster who gave it, assisted in a feast on the newly-grown ears of corn.\nSo came that mighty blessing into the world, and we owe all of those\nbeautiful fields of healthful grain to the dream of the brave boy Wunzh.", "tokens": [127, 62, 55, 67, 49, 790, 46, 9462, 46, 59, 435, 4697, 45, 50, 42, 55,

Ali Baba and his elder brother Cassim are the sons of a merchant. After the death of their father, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, building on their father's business - but Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter.\nOne day Ali Baba is at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, and he happens to overhear a group of forty thieves visiting their treasure store. The treasure is in a cave, the mouth of which is sealed by magic. It opens on the words \"Open, Simsim\", and seals itself on the words \"Close, Simsim\". When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave himself, and takes some of the treasure home.\nAli Baba borrows his sister-in-law's scales to weigh this new wealth of gold coins. Unbeknownst to Ali, she puts a blob of wax in the scales to find out what Ali is using them for, as she is curious to know what kind of grain her impoverished brother-in-law needs to measure. To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband, Ali Baba's rich and greedy brother, Cassim. Under pressure from his brother, Ali Baba is forced to reveal the secret of the cave. Cassim goes to the cave and enters with the magic words, but in his greed and excitement over the treasures forgets the magic words to get back out again. The thieves find him there, and kill him. When his brother does not come back, Ali Baba goes to the cave to look for him, and finds the body, quartered and with each piece displayed just inside the entrance of the cave to discourage any similar attempts in the future.\nAli Baba brings the body home, where he entrusts Morgiana, a clever slave-girl in Cassim's household, with the task of making others believe that Cassim has died a natural death. First, Morgiana purchases medicines from an apothecary, telling him that Cassim is gravely ill. Then, she finds an old tailor known as Baba Mustafa whom she pays, blindfolds, and leads to Cassim's house. There, overnight, the tailor stitches the pieces of Cassims' body back together, so that no one will be suspicious. Ali and his family are able to give Cassim a proper burial without anyone asking awkward questions.\nThe thieves, finding the body gone, realize that yet another person must know their secret, and set out to track him down. One of the thieves goes down to the town and comes across Baba Mustafa, who mentions that he has just sewn a dead man's body back together. Realizing that the dead man must have been the thieves' victim, the thief asks Baba Mustafa to lead the way to the house where the deed was performed. The tailor is blindfolded again, and in this state he is able to retrace his steps and find the house. The thief marks the door with a symbol. The plan is for the other thieves to come back that night and kill everyone in the house. However, the thief has been seen by Morgiana and she, loyal to her master, foils his plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood with a similar marking.\nWhen the 40 thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house and the head thief kills the lesser thief. The next day, another thief revisits Baba Mustafa and tries again, only this time, a chunk is chipped out of the stone step at Ali Baba's front door. Again Morgiana foils the plan by making similar chips in all the other doorsteps. The second thief is killed for his stupidity as well. At last, the head thief goes and looks for himself. This time, he memorizes every detail he can of the exterior of Ali Baba's house.\nThe chief of the thieves pretends to be an oil merchant in need of Ali Baba's hospitality, bringing with him Forty thieves hiding in oil jarsmules loaded with thirty-eight oil jars, one filled with oil, the other thirty-seven hiding the other remaining thieves. Once Ali Baba is asleep, the thieves plan to kill him. Again, Morgiana discovers and foils the plan, killing the thirty-seven thieves in their oil jars by pouring boiling oil on them. When their leader comes to rouse his men, he discovers that they are dead, and escapes.\nTo exact revenge, after some time the thief establishes himself as a merchant, befriends Ali Baba's son (who is now in charge of the late Cassim's business), and is invited to dinner at Ali Baba's house. The thief is recognized by Morgiana, who performs a dance with a dagger for the diners and plunges it into the heart of the thief when he is off his guard. Ali Baba is at first angry with Morgiana, but when he finds out the thief tried to kill him, he gives Morgiana her freedom and marries her to his son. Ali Baba is then left as the only one knowing the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it. Thus, the story ends happily for everyone except the forty thieves and Cassim.", "tokens": [105, 53, 50, 106, 42, 6972, 8209, 2263, 61, 66, 790, 50, 46, 63, 46, 60, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 491, 46,

"12": {"text": "whippety stourie story\nI am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman, who lived\nin a house called Kittlerumpit, though whereabouts in Scotland the house\nof Kittlerumpit stood nobody knows.\nSome folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the Debateable\nLand, which, as all the world knows, was on the Borders, where the old\nBorder Reivers were constantly coming and going; the Scotch stealing\nfrom the English, and the English from the Scotch. Be that as it may,\nthe widowed Mistress of Kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied.\nFor she had lost her husband, and no one quite knew what had become of\nhim. He had gone to a fair one day, and had never come back again, and\nalthough everybody believed that he was dead, no one knew how he died.\nSome people said that he had been persuaded to enlist, and had been\nkilled in the wars; others, that he had been taken away to serve as a\nsailor by the press-gang, and had been drowned at sea.\nAt any rate, his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied, for she was\nleft with a little baby-boy to bring up, and, as times were bad, she had\nnot much to live on.\nBut she loved her baby dearly, and worked all day amongst her cows, and\npigs, and hens, in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothes\nfor both herself and him.\nNow, on the morning of which I am speaking, she rose very early and went\nout to feed her pigs, for rent-day was coming on, and she intended to\ntake one of them, a great, big, fat creature, to the market that very\nday, as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long\nway towards paying her rent.\nAnd because she thought so, her heart was light, and she hummed a little\nsong to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm and\nher baby-boy on the other.\nBut the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair when she reached\nthe pig-stye, for there lay her cherished pig on its back, with its legs\nin the air and its eyes shut, just as if it were going to breathe its\nlast breath.\n\"What shall I do? What shall I do?\" cried the poor woman, sitting down\non a big stone and clasping her boy to her breast, heedless of the fact\nthat she had dropped her bucket, and that the pig's-meat was running\nout, and that the hens were eating it.\n\"First I lost my husband, and now I am going to lose my finest pig. The\npig that I hoped would fetch a deal of money.\"\nNow I must explain to you that the house of Kittlerumpit stood on a\nhillside, with a great fir wood behind it, and the ground sloping down\nsteeply in front.\nAnd as the poor young thing, after having a good cry to herself, was\ndrying her eyes, she chanced to look down the hill, and who should she\nsee coming up it but an Old Woman, who looked like a lady born.\nShe was dressed all in green, with a white apron, and she wore a black\nvelvet hood on her head, and a steeple-crowned beaver hat over that,\nsomething like those, as I have heard tell, that the women wear in\nWales. She walked very slowly, leaning on a long staff, and she gave a\nbit hirple now and then, as if she were lame.\nAs she drew near, the young widow felt it was becoming to rise and\ncurtsey to the Gentlewoman, for such she saw her to be.\n\"Madam,\" she said, with a sob in her voice, \"I bid you welcome to the\nhouse of Kittlerumpit, although you find its Mistress one of the most\nunfortunate women in the world.\"\n\"Hout-tout,\" answered the old Lady, in such a harsh voice that the young\nwoman started, and grasped her baby tighter in her arms. \"Ye have little\nneed to say that. Ye have lost your husband, I grant ye, but there were\nwaur losses at Shirra-Muir. And now your pig is like to die--I could,\nmaybe, remedy that. But I must first hear how much ye wad gie me if I\ncured him.\"\n\"Anything that your Ladyship's Madam likes to ask,\" replied the widow,\ntoo much delighted at having the animal's life saved to think that she\nwas making rather a rash promise.\n\"Very good,\" said the old Dame, and without wasting any more words she\nwalked straight into the pig-sty.\nShe stood and looked at the dying creature for some minutes, rocking to\nand fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could not\nunderstand; at least, she could only understand four of them, and they\nsounded something like this:\n    \"Pitter-patter,\n    Haly water.\"\nThen she put her hand into her pocket and drew out a tiny bottle with a\nliquid that looked like oil in it. She took the cork out, and dropped\none of her long lady-like fingers into it; then she touched the pig on\nthe snout and on his ears, and on the tip of his curly tail.\nNo sooner had she done so than up the beast jumped, and, with a grunt of\ncontentment, ran off to its trough to look for its breakfast.\nA joyful woman was the Mistress of Kittlerumpit when she saw it do this,\nfor she felt that her rent was safe; and in her relief and gratitude she\nwould have kissed the hem of the strange Lady's green gown, if she\nwould have allowed it, but she would not.\n\"No, no,\" said she, and her voice sounded harsher than ever. \"Let us\nhave no fine meanderings, but let us stick to our bargain. I have done\nmy part, and mended the pig; now ye must do yours, and give me what I\nlike to ask--your son.\"\nThen the poor widow gave a piteous cry, for she knew now what she had\nnot guessed before--that the Green-clad Lady was a Fairy, and a Wicked\nFairy too, else had she not asked such a terrible thing.\nIt was too late now, however, to pray, and beseech, and beg for mercy;\nthe Fairy stood her ground, hard and cruel.\n\"Ye promised me what I liked to ask, and I have asked your son; and your\nson I will have,\" she replied, \"so it is useless making such a din about\nit. But one thing I may tell you, for I know well that the knowledge\nwill not help you. By the laws of Fairy-land, I cannot take the bairn\ntill the third day after this, and if by that time you have found out my\nname I cannot take him even then. But ye will not be able to find it\nout, of that I am certain. So I will call back for the boy in three\ndays.\"\nAnd with that she disappeared round the back of the pig-sty, and the\npoor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone.\nAll that day, and all the next, she did nothing but sit in her kitchen\nand cry, and hug her baby tighter in her arms; but on the day before\nthat on which the Fairy said that she was coming back, she felt as if\nshe must get a little breath of fresh air, so she went for a walk in the\nfir wood behind the house.\nNow in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole, in the bottom of\nwhich was a bonnie spring well, the water of which was always sweet and\npure. The young widow was walking near this quarry hole, when, to her\nastonishment, she heard the whirr of a spinning-wheel and the sound of a\nvoice lilting a song. At first she could not think where the sound came\nfrom; then, remembering the quarry, she laid down her child at a tree\nroot, and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to\nthe edge of the hole and peeped over.\nShe could hardly believe her eyes! For there, far below her, at the\nbottom of the quarry, beside the spring well, sat the cruel Fairy,\ndressed in her green frock and tall felt hat, spinning away as fast as\nshe could at a tiny spinning-wheel.\nAnd what should she be singing but--\n    \"Little kens our guid dame at hame,\n    Whippety-Stourie is my name.\"\nThe widow woman almost cried aloud for joy, for now she had learned the\nFairy's secret, and her child was safe. But she dare not, in case the\nwicked old Dame heard her and threw some other spell over her.\nSo she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child;\nthen, catching him up in her arms, she ran through the wood to her\nhouse, laughing, and singing, and tossing him in the air in such a state\nof delight that, if anyone had met her, they would have been in danger\nof thinking that she was mad.\nNow this young woman had been a merry-hearted maiden, and would have\nbeen merry-hearted still, if, since her marriage, she had not had so\nmuch trouble that it had made her grow old and sober-minded before her\ntime; and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the Fairy for\na few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name.\nSo next day, at the appointed time, she went out with her boy in her\narms, and seated herself on the big stone where she had sat before; and\nwhen she saw the old Dame coming up the hill, she crumpled up her nice\nclean cap, and screwed up her face, and pretended to be in great\ndistress and to be crying bitterly.\nThe Fairy took no notice of this, however, but came close up to her, and\nsaid, in her harsh, merciless voice, \"Good wife of Kittlerumpit, ye ken\nthe reason of my coming; give me the bairn.\"\nThen the young mother pretended to be in sorer distress than ever, and\nfell on her knees before the wicked old woman and begged for mercy.\n\"Oh, sweet Madam Mistress,\" she cried, \"spare me my bairn, and take, and\nthou wilt, the pig instead.\"\n\"We have no need of bacon where I come from,\" answered the Fairy coldly;\n\"so give me the laddie and let me begone--I have no time to waste in\nthis wise.\"\n\"Oh, dear Lady mine,\" pleaded the Goodwife, \"if thou wilt not have the\npig, wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself?\"\nThe Fairy stepped back a little, as if in astonishment. \"Art thou mad,\nwoman,\" she cried contemptuously, \"that thou proposest such a thing? Who\nin all the world would care to take a plain-looking, red-eyed, dowdy\nwife like thee with them?\"\nNow the young Mistress of Kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty, and\nthe knowledge had never vexed her; but something in the Fairy's tone\nmade her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer.\n\"In troth, fair Madam, I might have had the wit to know that the like of\nme is not fit to tie the shoe-string of the High and Mighty Princess,\nWHIPPETY-STOURIE!\"\nIf there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground, and if it\nhad suddenly exploded beneath her feet, the Wicked Fairy could not have\njumped higher into air.\nAnd when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down the\nbrae, shrieking with rage and disappointment, for all the world, as an\nold book says, \"like an owl chased by witches.\"", "tokens": [2635, 3528, 46, 61, 66, 123, 61, 6893, 50, 46, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66, 5, 88, 8722, 4536, 996, 124, 46, 7548, 770, 105, 123, 61, 56, 59, 66,
